# User Stories

This folder contains user stories derived from the project's use case diagram. The primary file `user-stories.md` lists prioritized stories, acceptance criteria, and suggested API mappings to help developers and QA implement and verify functionality.

How to use:

1. Review each user story and confirm acceptance criteria.
2. Create backlog tasks for implementation, including the suggested endpoints.
3. Implement automated tests for each story (happy path + at least one edge case).
4. Once diagrams (use case, DFD, flowchart) are added to the repository, reference them from the related stories for clarity.

Filename expectations:

- `user-stories.md` â€” the canonical list of stories (this file).
